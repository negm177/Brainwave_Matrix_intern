It focuses on performing emotion analysis on tweets, covering the full data science workflow:

Loading and exploring the dataset

Cleaning and preprocessing text data

Mapping emotions into machine-readable labels

Visualizing sentiment distributions

Building and evaluating a machine learning model for emotion prediction
