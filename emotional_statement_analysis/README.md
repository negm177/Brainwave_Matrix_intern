# Emotion Analysis from Tweets

This project was completed as part of my internship at **Brainwave Matrix Solutions**.

It focuses on performing emotion analysis on tweets, covering the full data science workflow:

- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Cleaning and preprocessing text data
- Mapping emotions into machine-readable labels
- Visualizing sentiment distributions
- Building and evaluating a machine learning model for emotion prediction

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the emotion behind a tweet using traditional machine learning techniques. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, sentiment mapping, visualization, and model building.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Logistic Regression)

## Project Structure
- `emotion_analysis_FINAL_FULL.ipynb` — Complete Jupyter Notebook with full workflow
- `tweets_dataset.csv` — Dataset containing tweets and labeled emotions

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries (as mentioned inside the notebook)
3. Open the `emotion_analysis_FINAL_FULL.ipynb` notebook
4. Run all the cells sequentially

## Feedback
I'm open to feedback, suggestions, and comments. Always looking to learn and improve — feel free to reach out!
